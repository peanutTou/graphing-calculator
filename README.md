## Features:

- Implemented:
  - animate
    - read command
    - click check
    - read input
  - system
    - draw UI
    - understand command
    - manage history
  - graph
    - draw points with dots
    - draw points with lines
  - plot
    - calcluate points in polar coordinate
    - calculate points in cartesian coordinate
  - coor transform
    - translate points from cartesian coordinate to SFML coordinate
  - rpn_shuntingyard
    - read one argument functions
    - read many arguments functions
    - read operators + - * / ^
    - read unary operatory


<br><br>

- Partly implemented:
  - draw coordinate background
    - only can draw a vertical and horizontal axis for the origin, didn't draw more future (like small squares in cartesian coordinate or circles with different different radius in polar coordinate)
<br><br>

- Bugs
  - when the interval been large enought and draw points with lines is on, for some function that can make a large change in a short time, the graph will display a almost vertical line (tanx, cotx etc.)

<br><br>

# Reflections:

- this is a challange project, mostly on shuntingYard with different function. But after you complete it, you fill find out everything is worth, this is a really cool project.
